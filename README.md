Insert_Fact_Sales
    I had the csv files but I was having a hard time loading it into mysql workbench due to systems permissions and many more safe mode being enabled and stuff 
so I generated this using python script, all the insert statement are generated using python script no manual work is being done
I recommend trying to do the same way once ill upload the csv files too so you can do that too.
this is for beginners you can copy paste the insert statements if you arent able to load dataset
